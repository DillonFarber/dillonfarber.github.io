                    I served in the Air Force for 6 and half years as a Signals Intelligence Analyst. During that time, I maried, 
                        and had two daughters. After I seperated in 2018, I worked for a time with Raytheon, during which I start my 
                        journey to pursue a Software developemnt position. I started at the Community College of Aurora in Colorado. 
                        Where I took my first programming course, and fell in love. This led me to leaving Raytheon to move back home to 
                        Texas. Allowing me to go to Texas State University full time. Later graduating, and now working on personal 
                        projects and furthering my career path, by learning and tinkering with IOT projects.
